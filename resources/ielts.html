               <h2>What is IELTS?</h2>
               <p class="main-text">

                <h2>IELTS test format explained</h2>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Test takers who understand the format of IELTS are at an advantage. 
                     Make sure you’re familiar with how IELTS testing works.

                     There are two IELTS tests available, IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training. Both tests are graded in exactly the same way. 

                      You’ll take the first three parts of the test on the same day, in the following order: Listening, Reading and Writing (there are no breaks between these tests). 
                      Your Speaking test will be held either on the same day or seven days before or after that, depending on local arrangements.
